# Nonogram Editor - Implementation Summary

The Nonogram Editor is a web-based single-page application that allows users to view, play, create, and edit Nonogram puzzles. This document summarizes the implementation and features.

## Implemented Features

### Backend (FastAPI)
- JSON data loading with caching for performance
- API endpoints:
  - GET `/api/nonograms/list`: List all available nonograms
  - GET `/api/nonograms/search?clue={clue}`: Search nonograms by clue pattern
  - GET `/api/nonograms/{name}`: Get full nonogram data
  - POST `/api/nonograms/`: Create new nonogram (descriptors calculated automatically)
- Automatic calculation of row and column descriptors
- Unit tests for CRUD operations and API endpoints
- Performance optimizations for Raspberry Pi hosting

### Frontend (SvelteKit)
- Complete Single-Page Application (SPA) interface
- Components:
  - NonogramSelector: For selecting and searching nonograms
  - NonogramGrid: Interactive grid for playing, editing, and creating
  - NonogramClues: Display for row and column clues
  - StatusBar: Displaying app status and mode selection
- Modes:
  - Play Mode: Solve puzzles with validation
  - Edit Mode: Modify existing puzzles
  - Create Mode: Create new puzzles from scratch
- Features:
  - Cell interaction (left-click to fill, right-click to mark)
  - Drag operations for quick filling/marking
  - Auto-updating clues during edit/create
  - Solution validation with success message
  - Unsaved changes detection and warning
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes
- Component tests

### Deployment
- Deployment script for Raspberry Pi hosting
- Systemd service for backend
- Nginx configuration for serving frontend and proxying API requests

## Security Considerations
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- CORS configured for security
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimizations
- Svelte for minimal bundle size and optimal runtime performance
- FastAPI for high-performance backend
- Data caching to reduce file I/O operations
- Efficient grid rendering with CSS Grid

## Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- Clean component architecture
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Well-documented code
- Separation of concerns

## Documentation
- Detailed README with installation and usage instructions
- Architecture documentation
- API documentation via FastAPI's automatic docs
- Code comments and docstrings

## Outstanding Items for Future Development
- Persistent storage of created/edited nonograms
- User accounts and authentication
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Advanced editor tools (drawing tools beyond toggling cells)

## Conclusion
The implemented application successfully meets all the requirements specified in the PRD, providing a functional and user-friendly Nonogram editor with play, edit, and create capabilities. The code is well-structured, tested, and ready for deployment on Raspberry Pi hardware.
