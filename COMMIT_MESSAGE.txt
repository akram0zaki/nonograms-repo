fix: API client endpoint and response format handling

- Fixed API endpoint paths (/api/nonograms/list instead of /api/nonograms)
- Added proxy configuration in vite.config.js to forward API requests to backend
- Enhanced API client to handle multiple response formats for robustness
- Updated unit tests for API client
- Added comprehensive tests for proxy configuration and response format handling
- Added detailed CHANGELOG.md entries

This commit addresses the 404 errors users were experiencing with the
nonogram list loading by correctly configuring the API endpoints and
adding proper proxy setup to the backend server.
